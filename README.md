# Basic RPG Demo

This project is a simple demonstration of [Serpent](https://github.com/lispysnake/serpent) with an RPG theme.

### Building

To get the dependencies on Solus, issue the following command:

    sudo eopkg it -c system.devel sdl2-image-devel sdl2-devel mesalib-devel ldc dub dmd

As with Serpent, you will **currently** need to have `serpent-support` checked out and built locally.
We're going to address this to allow linking to dynamic bgfx, etc, to make this step much easier.

Make sure you have all modules cloned recursively:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Running

You'll need the shared libraries accessible when running a development
build of serpent, or alternatively use `serpent-support`:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../serpent-support/runtime/lib ./serpent
